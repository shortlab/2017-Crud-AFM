All curves done using Novascan 36 (R14 C15 confirmed)
Microsphere confirmed before and after all curves, appearance of cantilever looked similar before and after, it is mostly delaminated but there is a piece of coating by the microsphere itself
Same scale on oscilloscope and laser power and oscillation amplitude were kept throughout so images can be compared directly
The x-scale on the oscilloscope represents actual actuator voltage, compare to maximum measured range to get conversion to nm
The y-scale represents the FN voltage
