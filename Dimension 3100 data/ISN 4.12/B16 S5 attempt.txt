On landing, probe immediately retracts to highest position, making it impossible to obtain any curves.
I tried manually moving the stage up using the SPM motor, but at no point could find an appropriate location for a curve.
Perhaps there is artificial 'deflection' signal due to the sample optical properties?
Next I turned off the trigger (0.5V max force) and adjusted manually moving motor up/down, and was able to find a decent curve location.
This was on returning after finishing S6 with trigger, so the issue is with the sample not the AFM settings.
Perhaps what's happening is the coating is unstable in water and is expanding or exfoliating in some way?
